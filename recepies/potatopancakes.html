                <li><strong>4</strong> - large potatoes</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> - yellow onion</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> - egg, beaten</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> - teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li><strong>2</strong> - tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> - cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
         </ul>
        <h2>How to make</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Finely grate potatoes and onion into a large bowl. Drain off any excess liquid.</li>
                <li>Mix in egg, salt, and pepper. Add enough flour to make the mixture thick, about 2 to 4 tablespoons all together.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to low, about 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Drop two or three 1/4-cup mounds of batter into hot oil, and flatten with back of a spatula to make 1/2-inch-thick pancakes. Fry, turning pancakes once, until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Transfer pancakes to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain. Keep warm in the oven until serving. Repeat until all potato mixture is used.</li>
            </ol>
