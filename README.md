html-project
    Hello!
        This is my first project on odin, in this project i will be using html language, mostly building a skeleton for a website. This project will include home page and 3 local webpages with different recepies, where i will be using knowlage i got from odin to add images,links, create phatagraphs, titles and develop my git workflow skills.
        Project now is succesfully finished with things listed above, folder is organized and files aswell, commits were made by git after each web page development. Everything is uploaded to git now, most iretating thing was doing the same thing with all 3 pages except index.html. For the last one i copied the layout of the previous webpage i was working on wich made my life easier. 
        Can't wait to style my skeleton :).
